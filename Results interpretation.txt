Testing code threads

Test 1 - network buffer size: 10, output file: testOutput1.txt
Test 2 - network buffer size: 15, output file: testOutput2.txt
Test 3 - network buffer size: 20, output file: testOutput3.txt


There is no significant difference in the running times between the three test, but we did notice
that during the second test, the client sending thread was terminated before the receiving thread 
(this is the opposite of the 2nd and 3rd tests). This is most likely because of the unpredictable 
order of the thread execution. We know that the network thread will be the first one to be executed, 
but we can't know for sure which of the others will run next. Note that these tests were executed 
on the same machine, running the exact same programs and were done a few seconds apart.
